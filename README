Simple code to transcribe audio. You can put the code directory on path to call 'transcribe' which is a bash invoker which will source bin/activate; Processors/AudioProcessor.py reads your OpenAI api key from OPENAI_API_KEY env var, which I set in my venv activate but you can modify that as you please.

Usage example:

```
bash-3.2$ export PATH=$PATH:~/code/transcriber
bash-3.2$ transcribe ~/demo.m4a 
This is a short audio clip just to demonstrate the transcribed code.
Transcript copied to clipboard.
bash-3.2$ cat <<EOF
> This is a short audio clip just to demonstrate the transcribed code.
```



Put this directory on your path to be able to call transcribe, make sure it has +x bit set
